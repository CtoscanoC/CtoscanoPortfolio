3. Heading was changed from Website to " Horiseon Home Page" 
4. It was included the reset.css file and the first reset paragraph in the CSS was removed 
5. It was commented where appropriated for the change in the name of div/ and also for the alt used background image in CSS with a title
6. Some of the sections of the CSS were consolidated as to simplify and improve the CSS without affecting the end product
